Instrusion detection with ML/AI


### Capstone 

Author: Andres Garcia

#### Executive summary

#### Rationale
Why should anyone care about this question?

The ML/AI instrusion detection system is needed to detect malicious attacks, un-intended installations, remote access to IP information, etc. 
The ML/AI system can have several algorithms suited for different scenarios, but needs to be fast and cable 

#### Research Question
The question right now is what process and algorithms will be used. Several classifactions were used, but some failed to run due to GPU requirements
and also the json scripts needed to test the runs. Postman was used to test the HTML and JSON scripts, but this was not sufficient. 

What tools will be used is the ither question? VSCode, StreamLit, Pickle, Docker, and others. There were several issues along the way that have to 
be trouble shooted and resolved.

#### Data Sources
What data will you use to answer you question?

The data needed will be the score, accuracy, runtimes, and portability to run on the frontend of an HTML webpage which causes its own issues.

#### Methodology
What methods are you using to answer the question?
Right now several different tutorials are being taken. 
1. Streamlit
2. YouTube videos on Neural Networks
3. Courses on Neural Network applications and code that works
4. Several IDE's or platforms that work from prototype to production. 
5. Keep trying diffrent type of json, javascript, and python methods.


#### Results
What did your research find?

We found that tensorflow has its own flaws. It often complains that GPUs are not present and will not run. You are almost forced to use the free GPU 
resources from COLAB. We tried to SSH the resources from COLAB while using Cloudflare for SSH Tunnel security, but did not have sufficient time to 
work out the bugs and configuration settings.

#### Outline of project

Several notebooks were used and tested. But, only two will be posted. Some were taken from tutorials and worked out.
